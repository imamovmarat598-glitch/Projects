**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Three days ago, we launched GeoMark. The response has been amazing – thank you!

Today I want to share the feature that makes GeoMark truly unique: our partnership with Roscosmos, the Russian space agency.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED:

When you take a photo with GPS coordinates, how do you know they're accurate?

Standard phone GPS can be off by 10-50 meters. That's a problem when you're:
• Marking property boundaries (legal disputes are expensive)
• Documenting construction corners (errors delay projects)
• Recording scientific sample locations (bad data = bad research)

The solution? Verify with satellite imagery.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

INTRODUCING: SATELLITE VERIFICATION

GeoMark is the first and only consumer app with access to Roscosmos Geoportal satellite imagery.

Here's how it works:

1️⃣ Take a photo with GeoMark
   GPS coordinates are automatically recorded

2️⃣ Tap the satellite icon
   Choose from 4 satellite services:
   • Roscosmos Geoportal (Russian satellites)
   • Google Earth
   • Yandex Maps
   • OpenStreetMap

3️⃣ Verify your location
   See satellite imagery of the exact spot
   Confirm coordinates are accurate
   Spot errors before they become problems

[Watch 30-second demo →]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:

Dmitry, a construction site manager in Moscow, used GeoMark to document foundation corners for a new building.

When he verified the coordinates on Roscosmos satellite imagery, he noticed one corner marker was 15 meters off – in the wrong property!

By catching this before pouring concrete, he saved his company an estimated ₽850,000 in rework costs.

"The satellite view paid for itself in the first week," Dmitry told us.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY ROSCOSMOS?

Russian space satellites provide:
✓ High-resolution imagery (often better than Google in Russia/CIS)
✓ Recent updates (new imagery every few weeks)
✓ Coverage optimized for Eurasia geography
✓ Professional-grade accuracy

Previously, this data was only available through expensive enterprise contracts ($thousands per year).

Now it's in your pocket for $14.99/month.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TRY IT FREE:

Satellite access is included in the GeoMark Pro plan.

For the next 48 hours, use code SATELLITE50 for 50% off your first month of Pro.

That's full satellite access for just $7.50.

Hi [First Name],

It's been a week since we launched GeoMark, and the stories from our community have been incredible.

Today I want to share 5 real-world use cases from professionals like you.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. CONSTRUCTION SITE DOCUMENTATION

Igor, Project Manager @ Moscow Construction Ltd.

Challenge: Documenting daily progress for 12 sites, creating reports for clients every week.

Before GeoMark:
• Took photos with phone
• Manually noted GPS (often inaccurate)
• Spent 2 hours/week compiling reports
• Clients questioned accuracy

With GeoMark:
• One-tap photo capture with precise GPS
• Export to GeoJSON, attach to project management software
• Reports auto-generated in 15 minutes
• Satellite imagery proves accuracy to clients

Result: "Saves me 10 hours/month. Clients love the satellite view – makes us look super professional."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. LAND SURVEYING

Elena, Professional Surveyor @ GeoTech Services

Challenge: Preliminary site reconnaissance before bringing expensive total station equipment.

Before GeoMark:
• Rough smartphone photos
• Guessed coordinates, refined later in office
• Sometimes returned to site multiple times

With GeoMark:
• Accurate initial coordinates (±3m)
• Satellite verification on-site
• Export to ArcGIS for desktop refinement
• Fewer return trips

Result: "Cut our preliminary survey time by 40%. GeoMark pays for itself in fuel savings alone."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. ENVIRONMENTAL FIELD RESEARCH

Dr. Anna Sokolova, Environmental Scientist @ Moscow State University

Challenge: Recording 300+ soil sample locations across 50km² research area.

Before GeoMark:
• Garmin GPS unit ($600) + camera ($400)
• Manual data entry after field work
• Coordinate transcription errors
• Difficult to share with research team

With GeoMark:
• Single device (phone) for GPS + photos
• Instant export to CSV for analysis
• Team members access shared gallery
• Visual verification with satellite maps

Result: "Reduced equipment costs by 75% and eliminated transcription errors. Data quality improved dramatically."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. REAL ESTATE DOCUMENTATION

Alexei, Real Estate Agent @ Moscow Realty Group

Challenge: Showing clients exact property boundaries and neighborhood context.

Before GeoMark:
• Property photos without location proof
• Clients asked "how close to the park/metro/school?"
• Manually looked up satellite views separately

With GeoMark:
• Property photos with GPS-proven location
• Show satellite view during viewings
• Export location data for listing websites
• Professional credibility

Result: "Clients trust me more when I show satellite verification. Closed 2 deals specifically because of this."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5. OUTDOOR ADVENTURE DOCUMENTATION

Mikhail, Hiking Enthusiast & Blogger

Challenge: Documenting remote trails with accurate waypoints for blog followers.

Before GeoMark:
• Phone GPS inaccurate in mountains (±100m)
• Followers got lost trying to find spots
• No easy way to share coordinates

With GeoMark:
• Much better accuracy even in remote areas
• Export GPX file for sharing
• Followers import directly to their GPS devices
• Satellite view shows trail context

Result: "My blog followers love the GPX exports. GeoMark turned my hobby into a more professional resource."

**Email Deliverability Best Practices:**

1. **Authentication**: Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
2. **Warm-up**: Start with small batches (500/day), increase gradually
3. **Segmentation**: Don't send same email to everyone (personalize by tier, usage)
4. **Clean list**: Remove bounces, unengaged users after 90 days
5. **Subject line testing**: A/B test every major campaign
6. **Mobile optimization**: 60%+ opens happen on mobile
7. **CAN-SPAM compliance**: Include physical address, clear unsubscribe
8. **Timing**: Test send times (mornings 10-11am typically best)

**Email Service Provider Recommendations:**
- SendGrid (transactional + marketing)
- Mailchimp (marketing campaigns)
- Customer.io (user lifecycle automation)
- Postmark (transactional, high deliverability)

**Document Status**: Ready for implementation
**Total Sequences**: 4 launch emails, 2 onboarding, 1 re-engagement, 1 monthly newsletter
**Estimated Setup Time**: 2-3 days with email service provider
